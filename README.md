> **New decade, new languages, new tools**:
> cross platform compilation (cmake), cross platform/programming language development with (VSCode) employing Python, C++ and C# for a computer graphics (CG) full-stack deployment ( GPU to CPU character rendering and animation) to realise cross-operating system, cross-game engine, cross-algebra CG character algorithm development. This a `Rosetta stone` approach based on *literate programming*, i.e. writing documentation that contains the same code in different systems: e.g. a jupyter notebook showing basic GPU shader-based programming in Python, C++ and C#. This is a complete re-write in python of the `glGA` framework <http://george.papagiannakis.org/?page_id=513> using a modern `Entity - Components - Systems` in a `Scenegraph` approach.

## **APPENDICES**

## A. Why now in Python

Our objective in this SDK is two-fold:

- a) we want to teach, learn and expriment with key CG and underlying algebraic concepts as efficiently as possible, more than achieving absolute highest framerates. C/C++ are powerful but cluttered, error-prone low-level languages, that get in the way of this learning efficiency.
- b) we want to provide rapid prototyping, algorithmic understanding, experimentation and code equivalence between Python, C++ and C# across CPU and GPU frameworks and the two most prevailing, modern game engines (Unity and Unreal).
- c) we want to emphasize on *"literate programming"* and Python-Jupyter notebooks are the best current vehicle for that IMHO: "In literate programming the emphasis is reversed. Instead of writing code containing documentation, the literate programmer writes documentation containing code. No longer does the English commentary injected into a program have to be hidden in comment delimiters at the top of the file, or under procedure headings, or at the end of lines. Instead, it is wrenched into the daylight and made the main focus. The "program" then becomes primarily a document directed at humans, with the code being herded between "code delimiters" from where it can be extracted and shuffled out sideways to the language system by literate programming tools." <http://www.literateprogramming.com/index.html>

e.g. OpenGL is primarily a C API which for most CG applications today is actually used with C++ (or C#) in the industry. There are many good reasons for that: often the goal is to have the fastest possible code on the CPU side, since rendering for real-time visualization means that a *frame needs to be produced onscreen every 10, 16 or 33 milliseconds (for 100Hz, 60Hz, 30Hz refresh rates) and no time can be wasted*.

- Python code is more straightforward, easier to read, write, and debug
- It is less verbose (typically by a factor of 5-10 on the code size), and benefits from an extensive and intuitive set of built-ins (tuples, lists, dictionaries, arrays…)
- In particular Python constructs, like generators, list and dictionary comprehensions are a great way to reduce simple object construction loops to one readable line of code, or create iterators that unclutter the code. Keep those in mind when you write your application.
- Well written Python code can be quite fast already, and most inner loop tasks of interest to these practicals happen on the GPU anyway, once properly initialized.
- What’s more, Python has excellent wrappers to OpenGL and window libraries whose interface closely match their C counterpart. Which means anything you learn about writing code in Python directly maps to the C APIs.
- Python is already the programming language of choice for deep learning algortihms and data science in general, with numerous libraries and frameworks.
- Python is already being adopted by latest versions of 3D game engines, such as Unity and Unreal.
